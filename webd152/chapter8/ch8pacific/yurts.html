            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
              dome that can be opened.

            <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>
              Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
              gas fired stove. The luxury camping experience also includes
              electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
              restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>
              Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests
              also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
              weather with layers of clothing.
