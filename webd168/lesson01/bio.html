      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Short Introductory</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Emma and I am a Web Development major at Mesa.
        <br />
        I have been here for three years and started learning over a year ago.
        <br />
        Outside of school, I enjoy fashion, music, arts, animals, and traveling!
      </p>

      <h3>Reason, Gain, Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I am taking WEBD168 to fulfill my requirements for obtaining my
        Associates Degree in Web Development!
        <br />
        I hope to learn how to be efficient with coding and staying consistent
        to learning.
        <br />
        I feel that I haven't dedicated a lot of time to expressing my
        creativity and rather just <br />
        worked on projects that were school related. With this course, I strive
        to learn different <br />
        techniques, gain inspiration, and use this experience for future
        internships and jobs!
      </p>

      <h3>Prior Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I have taken previous HTML and CSS classes, learned about user
        accessibility, PHP <br />
        and SQL! <br />
        For a year, I was using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate for a club
        I was in as a <br />
        social media coordinator. I was able to grasp a basic learning of
        multimedia, and would <br />
        love to expand to photography to cross these medias together.
