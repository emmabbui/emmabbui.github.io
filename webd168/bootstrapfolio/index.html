        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Short Introductory</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Emma and I am a Web Development major at Mesa.
          <br />
          I have been here for three years and started learning over a year ago.
          <br />
          Outside of school, I enjoy fashion, music, arts, animals, and
          traveling!

          <h3>Reason, Gain, Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I am taking WEBD168 to fulfill my requirements for obtaining my
            Associates Degree in Web Development!
            <br />
            I hope to learn how to be efficient with coding and staying
            consistent to learning.
            <br />
            I feel that I haven't dedicated a lot of time to expressing my
            creativity and rather just worked on projects that were school
            related. With this course, I strive to learn different techniques,
            gain inspiration, and use this experience for future internships and
            jobs!

          <h3>Prior Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I have taken previous HTML and CSS classes, learned about user
            accessibility, PHP and SQL!
            <br />
            For a year, I was using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate for a
            club I was in as a social media coordinator. I was able to grasp a
            basic learning of multimedia, and would love to expand to
            photography to cross these medias together.
